# Possible Ingestion Methods
1. Website 
2. Web scraping 

## Website
* Looking like domain ownership required to use advanced website indexing - not so plausible for hotel website domains (we do not own those domains)

## Web Scraping 
* Looking more viable - would need a script that scrapes data off these websites Zied determined
* Define the table structure and export as CSV or JSON 
* Upload to Google Drive or any cloud storage that can be used by Vertex Agent
* Ingest data from the cloud storage
